# ✈️ Online Air Ticket Booking System (Java Console Application)

This is a simple console-based **Online Air Ticket Booking System** developed in Java. It allows users to register, login, view available flights, and book tickets. The system also maintains basic user session handling and seat availability tracking.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔐 User registration and login
- 🧳 Flight management (preloaded flights)
- 🔎 Search flights by destination
- 🎟️ Book tickets with seat availability check
- 👤 View logged-in customer details
- 🚪 Logout functionality

## 🧾 Sample Flights Preloaded

- `AI101`: New York → London, Seats: 5, Price: $450.00  
- `BA202`: Paris → Tokyo, Seats: 3, Price: $800.00  
- `DL303`: Sydney → Dubai, Seats: 4, Price: $620.00  

## 📦 Project Structure

All the code is contained within a single `Main` class:

- `Flight`: Represents an individual flight
- `BookingSystem`: Handles flight listings, bookings, user registration, login/logout
- `main()`: Runs the interactive console menu for users
